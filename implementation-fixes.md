# Implementation Fixes for Resume Kit Generator

## Issues Fixed

### 1. OpenAI API Compatibility Issue
The main issue was with the OpenAI API call in our JSON caller. The error `Unknown parameter: 'response_format.schema'` indicated that we were using a parameter that's not supported by the current OpenAI API version.

**Fix:**
- Removed the `schema` parameter from the `response_format` object in the OpenAI API call
- Used only `{ type: "json_object" }` for the `response_format` parameter
- Added schema information to the system prompt instead
- Added version detection to handle different OpenAI model capabilities

### 2. Enhanced Model Selection
Added a comprehensive list of the latest AI models from all providers:

**OpenAI:**
- GPT-4o (Latest)
- GPT-4 Turbo
- GPT-4o
- GPT-4
- GPT-3.5 Turbo

**Anthropic:**
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Latest)
- Claude 3 Opus
- Claude 3 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 2.1

**Google:**
- Gemini 1.5 Pro (Latest)
- Gemini 1.5 Flash
- Gemini 1.0 Pro

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in the JSON caller
- Added better logging for debugging
- Improved error display in the UI

## How to Test

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web && pnpm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Resume Generator page at `/jobbot`

3. Test with different file types and AI models:
   - Upload a standard text-based PDF resume
   - Try different AI models from the dropdown
   - Check that the error handling works properly

4. If you encounter any issues:
   - Check the console logs for detailed error information
   - The UI should show helpful error messages and provide options to retry or switch providers

## Known Limitations

1. The OpenAI API schema parameter issue is fixed, but there might be other compatibility issues with specific model versions.

2. Some models might have different capabilities for JSON response formatting, which could affect the quality of the generated output.

3. The Buffer deprecation warning (`Buffer() is deprecated`) still appears and should be fixed in a future update.

4. The worker module error (`Cannot find module 'C:\Users\humza\resume_bot\apps\web\.next\worker-script\node\index.js'`) appears to be a Next.js internal issue and doesn't affect functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Buffer deprecation warning by replacing all instances of `new Buffer()` with `Buffer.from()`

2. Add more robust fallback mechanisms for different AI providers

3. Implement caching to improve performance and reduce API calls

4. Add more detailed logging and error reporting for production environments
