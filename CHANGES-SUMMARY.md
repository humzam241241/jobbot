# Changes Summary

## Authentication Fixes

### 1. Sign Out Button Functionality
- **Problem**: Sign out button wasn't working properly
- **Solution**: Updated the `handleSignOut` function in `Navbar.tsx` to:
  - Clear all auth-related cookies and local storage
  - Use `router.push('/login')` and `router.refresh()` to force navigation
  - Add proper error handling and feedback

### 2. Forced Sign In on Application Start
- **Problem**: Users weren't being forced to sign in when starting the application
- **Solution**: Modified `start-jobbot.bat` to:
  - Clear authentication cookies before starting
  - Set `FORCE_LOGOUT=1` environment variable
  - Open the browser directly to the login page instead of the dashboard
  - Added PowerShell command to clear browser cookies

## Pipeline Fixes

### 1. Font Handling
- **Problem**: Missing font files causing rendering failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Created placeholder font files in `apps/web/lib/pdf/fonts/`
  - Implemented `init-fonts.ts` to ensure font files exist at runtime
  - Added automatic font initialization to the pipeline

### 2. Error Handling and Fallbacks
- **Problem**: Pipeline would fail completely if any step failed
- **Solution**:
  - Added try-catch blocks around critical pipeline steps
  - Implemented fallbacks for text extraction, rendering, and other steps
  - Ensured the pipeline always produces some output, even if not optimal

### 3. OCR Module
- **Problem**: OCR module was using canvas which caused build errors
- **Solution**:
  - Simplified OCR fallback to not rely on canvas rendering
  - Added fallback text blocks when OCR fails

## Overall Improvements

1. **Robustness**: The pipeline now gracefully handles errors at each step
2. **Fallbacks**: Each component has fallback mechanisms to ensure the pipeline continues
3. **Initialization**: Added automatic font and directory initialization
4. **Authentication**: Improved sign out functionality and forced sign in
5. **Error Reporting**: Enhanced error logging throughout the pipeline

## Testing

To verify these changes:
1. Run the application using `start-jobbot.bat`
2. Confirm you're redirected to the login page
3. Sign in and test the resume generation pipeline
4. Test the sign out button functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Real Font Files**: Replace placeholder font files with actual Inter font files
2. **Enhanced OCR**: Implement a more robust OCR solution for scanned PDFs
3. **UI Feedback**: Add better error messages and progress indicators
4. **Performance**: Optimize the pipeline for better performance
