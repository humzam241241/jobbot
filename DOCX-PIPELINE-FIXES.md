# DOCX Pipeline Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dependency Issues**
   - Removed `@types/mammoth` which doesn't exist in npm registry
   - Kept `mammoth` package which works fine without type definitions
   - Modified package.json files to remove problematic dependencies

2. **Batch File Issues**
   - Fixed browser cookie clearing command that was failing
   - Added better error handling for dependency installation
   - Made the batch file continue even if some steps fail
   - Created required directories automatically

3. **Implementation Changes**
   - Created a simplified DOCX pipeline that works with minimal dependencies
   - Used a simple logger implementation to avoid dependency issues
   - Added proper error handling throughout the pipeline

## How to Test

1. Run the `test-docx-pipeline.bat` file
2. The browser will open to http://localhost:3000/docx-test
3. Upload a DOCX file and enter a job description
4. Click "Process DOCX" to test the pipeline
5. Download the resulting tailored DOCX file

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Batch Files**
   - `start-jobbot.bat` - Fixed dependency installation and error handling
   - `test-docx-pipeline.bat` - Created for testing the DOCX pipeline

2. **Package Files**
   - `package.json` - Updated dependencies
   - `apps/web/package.json` - Removed `@types/mammoth`

3. **DOCX Pipeline**
   - `apps/web/lib/docx-pipeline.ts` - Simple pipeline implementation
   - `apps/web/app/api/docx/route.ts` - API endpoint for processing DOCX files
   - `apps/web/app/api/docx/[requestId]/download/route.ts` - Download endpoint
   - `apps/web/app/docx-test/page.tsx` - Test page for the DOCX pipeline

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Implementation**
   - Implement full DOCX parsing with structure detection
   - Add LLM integration for tailoring content
   - Create proper rendering for tailored content

2. **Integration**
   - Integrate with existing authentication system
   - Add credit tracking
   - Connect to the dashboard UI
